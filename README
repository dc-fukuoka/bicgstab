asymmetric linear system solver by using BiCGSTAB method.
this is for study of finite element method.
BiCGSTAB method is an iterative method, so it is suitable for parallelization, MPI version is possible.(though I have not implemented yet)
this time just used OpenMP for simpleness.

$ make
$ OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 ./a.out
 size:        1024
 BiCGSTAB method converged.
 iter, res:         161  8.122849438702899E-011
 time[s]:  0.247600000000000
 check the result: calc res = b - A*x
 residual:  8.122849438702899E-011

$ OMP_NUM_THREADS=16 KMP_AFFINITY=compact ./a.out
 size:        1024
 BiCGSTAB method converged.
 iter, res:         161  7.729346016224966E-011
 time[s]:  9.450000000000000E-002
 check the result: calc res = b - A*x
 residual:  7.729346016224966E-011

some notes:
- it might be better to replace a_dot_x() with BLAS dgemv() for dense matrix
- similarly, better to replace x_dot_y() with BLAS ddot()
- I did some large asymmetric sparse matrix tests by using this, it looks that sometimes it does not converge...(espicially for large matrix)
  for symmetric case, it seems to converge even in the large case.
  need to study the condition and how to improve(or find another iterative method for asymmetric case)
